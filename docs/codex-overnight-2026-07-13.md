# Codex overnight goals — 2026-07-13

Handoff for autonomous overnight work. Claude (Opus) hit its weekly limit; this doc
is the source of truth so Codex can continue without a human in the loop until morning.

---

## 0. Where things stand (read first)

- `main` @ `f2b5edd` — the **production-hardening** + **active-monitoring** work is
  committed, merged, and **pushed to `origin`** (github.com/mukta2701/ComplianceHub).
- Hosted Supabase prod (`etpiqjbehbchkkzmbjzt`) is **fully migrated** — `migration list`
  shows every local migration == remote, including `20260712100000_hardening_ratelimit_errors`.
- Working tree is **clean**. Tests green at merge: lint + tsc clean (1 pre-existing
  `_val` unused-var warning only), **306/306 vitest**, `next build` green.

### What is DONE and must NOT be redone
Rate limiting (Postgres-backed), self-hosted error logging (`app_errors`), error
boundaries, `/api/health`, AES-256-GCM secrets-at-rest (`src/lib/security/secrets.ts`,
wired through every token/webhook site), Jira SSRF allowlist, password-reset flow,
`siteUrl()` fail-fast, team lifecycle (role/remove/revoke), active compliance
monitoring (`src/features/monitoring/`, `/api/cron/monitor`).

---

## 1. DO NOT ATTEMPT (out of scope for Codex — needs the human)
These are blocked on dashboards / secrets Codex cannot supply. Do not fake, stub, or
work around them:
- **Vercel env vars** (`APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `CRON_SECRET`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`) and
  triggering the Vercel prod deploy — no Vercel CLI on this machine; dashboard only.
- **Supabase Auth email-confirmation toggle** — deliberately left OFF (enabling without
  SMTP breaks sign-ups). Leave it.
- **Real OAuth connectors** (GitHub/Google/AWS live wiring) — needs the user's OAuth apps
  + client secrets. You MAY improve adapter *code + tests behind the existing flags*
  (`INTEGRATIONS_LIVE` / `MONITORING_LIVE` / `EVIDENCE_LIVE`), but they must stay
  sandbox/fake by default. Never commit a secret.

---

## 2. Hard rules (this repo will bite you otherwise)
1. **No `pnpm` on PATH.** Use `npx` or `./node_modules/.bin/*`. (`next`, `vitest`,
   `eslint`, `tsc`, `playwright` all resolve via `./node_modules/.bin`.)
2. **`"use server"` files may only export async functions.** Any constant (e.g. a row
   cap, a config map) MUST live in a separate non-`"use server"` module (`limits.ts`
   pattern). This fails at **build**, not vitest — so always run the full gate.
3. **Pre-commit privacy hook false-positives.** Commit with `--no-verify` when it blocks
   on known false fingerprints. (Do still eyeball your own diff for real secrets.)
4. **Playwright:** run with `--workers=1` (or `2`). Its web server uses `npm run dev`;
   with `reuseExistingServer` on, you can instead start
   `./node_modules/.bin/next dev` yourself first.
5. **Local DB writes:** two Docker runtimes both host `supabase_db_compliancehub`; the
   IPv4/IPv6 split makes `supabase db reset` flaky. Apply local SQL via
   `docker exec -i supabase_db_compliancehub psql` against `127.0.0.1:54322`.
   **Do NOT run `supabase db push`** (that hits hosted prod — human-gated).
6. **New migrations:** idempotent `create ... if not exists` / guarded `alter`, mirroring
   `20260712100000`. Add a matching pgTAP file under `supabase/tests/database/` for any
   new table/RLS. pgTAP runs in CI; it can't run locally here.
7. `allowedDevOrigins: ["127.0.0.1"]` in `next.config.ts` is load-bearing for dev — leave it.

## 3. Definition of done for EVERY task
- `npm run verify` is **green** (lint → tsc → vitest → build). Non-negotiable.
- New behaviour has a test (TDD: red → green). Pure logic → vitest; DB/RLS → pgTAP.
- Then **self-merge to `main`** (fast-forward), push, and **delete the branch**.
  Mukta wants short-lived branches — one task, one branch, gone once merged. No sprawl.

## 4. Branch & concurrency discipline
- **One agent per file-area.** The tasks below are ordered to NOT overlap in files so
  parallel agents don't collide. If you must touch a shared file (`globals.css`,
  `app-shell.tsx`, a shared action file), take it alone and merge before the next agent
  starts on it.
- Branch naming: `codex/<short-task-slug>`. Rebase on latest `main` before merging.
- If verify won't go green after a genuine effort, **stop, leave the branch, and write a
  one-line note in `docs/codex-overnight-notes.md`** rather than merging broken work.

---

## 5. Task queue (priority order — each is independent)

### T1 — Docs accuracy sweep  *(file-area: docs/ + README)*
README/docs overstate policy-template capabilities and may still mention `pnpm`.
- Correct policy-template claims to match what actually ships: 10 original starter
  policies are selectable from the authoring form and editable after pre-fill. Do not
  imply they are official ISO templates; keep backlog/current guidance aligned.
- Grep for `pnpm` in docs and fix to `npm`/`npx` (only `package-lock.json` exists).
- **DoD:** `npm run verify` green (docs-only, so trivially green); merge.

### T2 — Deprecated Zod idiom sweep  *(file-area: validation schemas)*
Replace deprecated `z.string().uuid()` with `z.uuid()` across schemas.
- `grep -rn "z.string().uuid()" src` → migrate each. Watch for other deprecated idioms
  the linter flags. Also kill the lone `_val` unused-var eslint warning if trivial.
- **DoD:** no behaviour change; existing tests still pass; lint warning count drops; merge.

### T3 — Transactional recurrence regeneration  *(file-area: daily sweep / recurrence)*
Recurrence regeneration is currently non-transactional (partial-failure can leave
orphaned/duplicate task rows). Wrap the delete-old + insert-new in a single DB
transaction (or a security-definer RPC that does both atomically).
- Add a vitest (pure) and/or pgTAP proving no partial state on mid-op failure.
- **DoD:** verify green + new test; merge.

### T4 — Auditor-view access log  *(file-area: auditor tokens)*
Deferred from Phase C: time-boxed auditor access has no access log. Add an
`auditor_access_log` table (org-scoped, owner-readable RLS, service/RPC insert) and
record each successful `audit_view_for_token` resolution (token id, ts). Surface a small
"recent auditor views" list on the owner-facing audits/settings area.
- New migration (idempotent) + pgTAP for the RLS (owner-only read, cross-tenant denied).
- **DoD:** verify green + pgTAP; merge.

### T5 — Monitoring Realtime toast push  *(file-area: alert-toaster + a browser client)*
`components/alert-toaster.tsx` polls `fetchRecentAlertsAction` every 15s because no
browser Supabase client exists (app is server-rendered + server-actions only). Add a
minimal browser client (anon key, `@supabase/ssr`) and subscribe to
`monitoring_findings` inserts for the active org, falling back to the existing poll if
Realtime is unavailable. Keep it flag-safe and don't leak the service key.
- **DoD:** verify green; a test around the fallback logic; merge. (Realtime itself can't
  be unit-verified here — keep the change small and the fallback intact.)

### T6 — WhatsApp/Twilio alert adapter  *(file-area: monitoring delivery)*
`src/features/monitoring/application/deliver.ts` has a whatsapp **stub**. Flesh out a
real Twilio adapter behind a `TWILIO_*` env gate, defaulting to the fake/no-op when
unset (so no creds needed to run). Route by `min_severity` like the Slack adapter.
- Mirror the Slack adapter's port/payload split; add a deterministic fake + test.
- **DoD:** verify green + delivery test; merge. Do NOT hit the real Twilio API.

### Lower priority / only if time (pick one, don't half-do many)
- **T7** Import history + undo (Phase B.5 deferral) — new `import_runs` table, record each
  run, allow undo of the last import. Bigger; scope carefully.
- **T8** KPI trend + inline edit UI (Phase C deferral).
- **T9** Single colour-tokenisation pass — replace inline hexes (`#596273` `#edf0f4`
  `#fffbef` `#efe1aa`, alert `#f0c9c9` `#fdf2f2`, auth-page hexes) with the AA tokens in
  `globals.css`; restore the tasks-table Save secondary border; add a `.field` class so
  `soa/[id]` inline inputs get the brand focus ring. **Touches `globals.css` — take alone.**

## 6. PRIME DIRECTIVE — "working & ready by morning"
This outranks every task below. By morning `main` must be in a verified, deployable,
**proven-working** state. A green + working `main` with 2 features shipped beats a broken
`main` with 6. If a change risks that, leave it unmerged on its branch. **Never leave
`main` broken.**

"Working & ready" is not "it compiles". It means ALL of:
1. `npm run verify` green on `main` (lint → tsc → vitest → build).
2. The app **boots and runs** locally — you started it (`./node_modules/.bin/next dev`),
   hit `GET /api/health` (ok), signed in, and clicked through the core pages (dashboard,
   risks, SoA, tasks, evidence, monitoring, settings) with **zero** runtime/500 errors in
   the server log or browser console.
3. Every feature you merged was **exercised at runtime**, not just unit-tested. For a
   schema change: apply the migration locally (`docker exec -i supabase_db_compliancehub
   psql` @ 127.0.0.1:54322) and drive the feature end to end before merging.
4. The readiness report (§8) is written.

Per-task merge gate (in addition to §3): after `npm run verify` is green, do the runtime
smoke for the exact flow you changed. Only then self-merge. Local DB only — **never**
`supabase db push` (hosted prod is human-gated).

## 7. FINAL READINESS PASS (do this LAST, before going quiet — most important step)
1. Confirm you are on the latest `main`.
2. `npm run verify` — must be green.
3. Start the app fresh, `GET /api/health`, sign in, click through dashboard, risks, SoA,
   tasks, evidence, monitoring, settings. Confirm zero runtime errors end to end.
4. If anything is red or broken, and you can't fix it safely, **revert the offending
   merge** so `main` returns to the last known-good state, and record it in the report.

## 8. Morning readiness report
Append to `docs/codex-overnight-notes.md`:
- **GO / NO-GO for deploy**, with a one-line justification (based on §7, not hope).
- Tasks merged (with commit SHAs); tasks skipped (with reason).
- Any new blocker that needs the human.
- Confirm the **only** remaining human step is: set Vercel env vars
  (`APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `CRON_SECRET`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`) + trigger the Vercel
  deploy. Flag loudly if anything else is now required.

Bottom line: "ready by morning" = `main` is proven-good and one ~5-minute Vercel action
away from live. Getting there safely is the job; shipping extra features is a bonus.
